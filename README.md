# dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files for the tools I use day-to-day.

![Screenshot](/.config/yadm/Screenshot.png?raw=true "Some of the tools in use")

**Note**: these dotfiles are now for the [fish shell][fish] and
[Spacemacs][spacemacs] only, if you're looking for the *bash* or *zsh* or *vim*
or *neovim* versions you'll want to check out [version 2.2.0][v2].

These configurations are designed to work out-of-the-box on both MacOS and Arch
Linux, but can be easily adapted to other distributions.

## Installation

I use a simple tool called [yadm][yadm] to manage my dotfiles, but it's not
required! However if you're interested in using yadm it's as simple as:

```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles.git
yadm status
yadm bootstrap
```

Otherwise you can copy over individual files and directories as needed.
